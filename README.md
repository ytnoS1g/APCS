# APCS
This was the repo that I partially used in my senior year of high school while doing AP Computer Science through Florida Virtual School (FLVS). 
It does not include many assignments towards the latter half of the year, as most projects do when workload gets increases and people get lazy. However, I am keeping it here as a reference on how I solved things and how my style with Java has improved over time.
